ICTRP data for control samples were downloaded from ICTRP on 23rd November 2020 from the 'full data download' here: https://www.who.int/ictrp/data/en/ and were up to date on 23rd November. Checking the database on 8th December 2020 there was no further update. Two files:

1. "ICTRP_export_datafields.txt" - this is the datafield that corresponds to the column names 
2. "ICTRPFullExport-672212-23-11-20.zip"- this is the raw data in csv. It is too large to put on github so it will be used on
