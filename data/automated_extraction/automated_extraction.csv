For the fear acquisition phase, they will look at visual images of a scene containing a desktop lamp which lights up with a color. One color will be associated with a mild electrical shock (the CS+), the other colored circle is never associated with shock (the CS-). This will be followed immediately by the fear extinction phase in which they will look at both colored lights which will never be followed by shock. This paradigm is adapted from Milad, Orr, Pitman, & Rauch (2005). SCR will be recorded to reflect sympathetic arousal. SCR amplitude typically increases to the CS+ compared to the CS- in the acquisition phase, and then gradually reduces over the extinction phase. The slope of decline of SCR over the fear extinction phase reflects how well an individual can inhibit/regulate their fear and reflects their capacity for fear extinction learning.
