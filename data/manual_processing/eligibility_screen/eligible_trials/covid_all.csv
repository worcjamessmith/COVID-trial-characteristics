Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruation) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study. Male patients must not donate sperm as long as contraception is required. For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.

Baseline clinical parameters will include the presentation of<br>             fever and any respiratory symptoms, both of upper respiratory tract and dyspnea,<br>             affecting the general state or gastrointestinal manifestations, since it is known that<br>             in elderly people the COVID-19 can present with atypical symptoms for a time that is<br>             difficult to determine, but it also tends to evolve to respiratory failure quickly and<br>             is associated with high mortality. For this reason, regardless of the time that has<br>             elapsed since the estimated onset of symptoms, patients with moderate - WHO grade 3,<br>             in whom the presence of fever, mild dyspnea or any gastrointestinal manifestation<br>             attributable to COVID-19 make an admission (in the case of hospital) and directed<br>             treatment (in all cases) advisable, will be candidates for inclusion in the study.<br>             Patients with moderate disease and oxygen requirements (WHO grade 4) and patients with<br>             severe pneumonia, but who can be managed initially with high flow oxygen therapy (WHO<br>             grade 5) may also be included in the study. The clinical diagnosis may be supported by<br>             radiological changes (via chest radiography, if available) suggestive of bilateral<br>             (established or incipient) pneumonia. At the time of diagnosis, biomarkers will also<br>             be collected, in an analysis that will include increased levels of C-reactive protein<br>             [PCR] and/or ferritin and microbiological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.<br><br>          3. Patients in whom the current clinical situation and the basal functional situation<br>             condition a prognosis that makes them consider a limited therapeutic ceiling, which<br>             includes the contraindication of applying more aggressive (e.g. non-invasive<br>             ventilation) or invasive measures (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation or orotracheal<br>             intubation and mechanical ventilation), both in patients admitted to the Geriatric<br>             Unit (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona) and in those admitted to a transicional care<br>             center.

This signifies that an early pro-inflammatory reaction has been started in the lung. It is postulated that early anakinra treatment in these patients may halt this reaction and prevent development of SRF.  In the SAVE study patients with sars-cov-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus at high risk for progression to MSDs will be detected using the suPAR biomarker. They will begin early treatment with anakinra in the effort to prevent progression in SAA.,NA,NA,NA,parent,NA,2020-04-14

A total of 216 patients who are<br>        recruited in 2 quarantine hospitals (15th of May hospital, Cairo, and Al Rajhi hospital,<br>        Assiut), will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (72 patient in each treatment arm), to<br>        receive either the fixed combination of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (400 mg and 90 mg, orally)<br>        once daily for 14 days, plus the standard care treatment regimen (SCT) for COVID-19<br>        patients according to the Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) protocol (Group 1), or<br>        nitazoxanide (500 mg, orally) four times per day for 14 days, plus STC (Group 2), or SCT<br>        alone (Group 3). All treatment groups will be followed up by laboratory investigations and<br>        PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus at the time of enrollment, days 5, 8, 11, and 14. Supportive care<br>        comprised, as necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation,<br>        antibiotic agents, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal<br>        membrane oxygenation (ECMO). To ensure a balanced distribution of case severities in all<br>        study groups, randomization will be stratified based on the case severity index issued by<br>        WHO<br>        (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf)<br>        .<br><br>        Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients or the patient's legal<br>        representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent.

The authors<br>        vouch for data completeness and accuracy and adherence to the trial protocol.<br><br>        Inclusion Criteria:<br><br>          -  This study will include patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and admitted to<br>             COVID-19 quarantine hospitals. Included patients should be > 12 years old, with<br>             creatinine clearance > 30 mL/ml, and without any malignancy. Patients with COVID-19<br>             infection are classified clinically into mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases<br>             according to the management guide for COVID-19 published by the Egyptian Ministry of<br>             Health and Population. Mild cases are defined as patients in whom clinical symptoms<br>             are mild, and no pneumonia manifestations can be found in imaging. Moderate cases are<br>             defined as patients having symptoms such as fever and respiratory tract symptoms, etc.<br>             and pneumonia manifestations can be seen in imaging. Severe cases are patients who<br>             meet any of the following criteria; (a) respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, (b) oxygen<br>             saturations< 93% at a rest state, (c) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/<br>             Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)<300 mm Hg, or (d) patients with more than 50%<br>             lesions progression within 24 to 48 hours in lung imaging should be treated as severe<br>             cases. Finally, critical patients are those who are meeting any of the following<br>             criteria; (a) occurrence of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, or<br>             (b) the presence of shock; other organ failures that require monitoring and treatment<br>             in the ICU.

Since supplemental oxygen will be indispensable in some patients, the A-a gradient will be normalized against age and FiO2 expected A-a gradient, according to validated formulas. If patients leave hospital between day 6 and day 15, that day of discharge will be taken as measurement point for primary endpoint instead of day 15. For patients on ECMO the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and Aa-gradient cannot be calculated as in this case the FiO2 will be missing.

Participants will be adults with potential exposure, within 8 days, to a specific identified individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, who are therefore at appreciable risk of imminently developing COVID-19, based on available risk assessment at time of enrollment, within any of the following settings: ? <br>-Long term care facilities, including skilled nursing homes, assisted living homes, independent living residences for the elderly. Residents, health care workers in such facilities, and other staff of such facilities are eligible under this criterion. For participants entering the study from these settings, “potential exposure to a specific identified individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection"" is defined to mean the occurrence of SARS-COV-2 infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in another resident of the facility or in a staff member of the facility. ?<br>-Industrial settings shown to have been at high risk for SARS-COV-2 transmission, including but not limited to meatpacking plants. Workers in such facilities are eligible under this criterion. ? -Military settings including but not limited to barracks, ships, or other close-quarters working environments. Military and civilian personnel exposed in such settings are eligible. ? <br>-Health care facilities. Health care workers and other staff exposed in such setting are eligible under this criterion. ? <br>-University or college dormitories. Students exposed in such setting are eligible. ? <br>Household contacts. Any adult living in the same household as an index case are eligible under this criterion. ? <br>-Others settings of similar close or high-density inter-personal proximity.
