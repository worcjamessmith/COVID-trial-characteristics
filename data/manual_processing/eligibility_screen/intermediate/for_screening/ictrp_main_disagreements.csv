1,0,NA,NA,Feasibility study of stem-cell enriched autologous lipotransfer to treat oro-facial fibrosis in systemic sclerosis,"<br>                Sys-Stem is a single centre trial that will take place at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust directly assessing feasibility for the main multi-centre trial.<br><br>                Sys-Stem is an open-label design and will consist of 50 patients. 25 patients in the treatment arm and 25 patients in the control arm. A sample size of 50 was chosen for pragmatic reasons and is suitable for a feasibility study of this kind. We will attain information from a sample size of 50 that will allow a power calculation for the future multi-centre trial. SSc patients are high-risk surgical candidates and so it would be unethical and dangerous to perform a sham operation or placebo on a control group. For this reason, the control arm will be a no-treatment concurrent control receiving care-as-usual. However, we will not withhold treatment from the participants in the control arm. All<br>                participants randomised to the control arm will be offered the intervention at the end of the assessment period/after 6 months. This ensures that our study is ethical and patient-focused.<br><br>                Due to the study design, study participants cannot be blinded to the treatment they receive. To reduce bias, outcome assessors (researchers) will be blinded. To ensure this, participants will be assessed in a private clinic appointment by Prof. Butler who will have performed the surgeries and will be aware of the allocations. All clinical assessments and follow up related to the surgical procedure will be performed by Prof. Butler. The participants will be asked not to disclose whether they have received the treatment or not to the other assessors. All other assessments and follow-up will be carried out by the blinded assessors in a separate clinic.<br><br>                We wi",http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN17793055,A study of the benefit of fat transfer to the peri-oral area for scleroderma patients,ISRCTN,ISRCTN17793055,2019-09-10,2019-10-01,FALSE,Interventional,Single centre interventional open cohort study (Other),Not Applicable,50,UCL,United Kingdom,Perioral fibrosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) <br>Musculoskeletal Diseases <br>Perioral fibrosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma),NA,NULL,10/09/2019,01/10/2019,ISRCTN,31 August 2020,Nil known;Nil known;42520,Carole,Frosdick,Royal Free Hospital                    Department of Plastic Surgery                    Pond Street,carole.frosdick1@nhs.net,+442037582000 ex 36918,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ongoing,NULL,National Institute for Health Research; Grant Codes: PB-PG-1216-20042,NA,NA,Both,Inclusion criteria: <br>                1.

There were no significant differences in safety and tolerability between the 2 formulations or between dietary conditions at a single dose of 2 mg.,2019-03-28,1900-01-01,"In the crossover group of 2 mg, the mean age (min to max) was 25.2 (20 to 34) years, the mean height (min to max) was 170.97 (159.0 to 183.0) cm, the mean body weight (min to max) was 62.10 (53.1 to 70.7) kg, and the mean BMI (min to max) was 21.27 (18.6 to 24.8). In the 10 mg group, the mean age (min to max) was 22.4 (21 to 26) years, the mean height (min to max) was 172.79 (161.5 to 177.8) cm, the mean body weight (min to max) was 66.15 (59.2 to 74.5) kg, and the mean BMI (min to max) was 22.19 (19.2 to 24.4).","In the crossover group of 2 mg, all of the enrolled 18 subjects received solution/fasted, tablet/fed, and tablet/fasted administrations and completed the study. In the 10 mg group, all of the enrolled 8 subjects received the study drug and completed the study.","Five AEs were reported in 3 of 18 subjects in the crossover group of 2 mg. Two AEs in 1 subject in the solution/fasted cohort, 1 AE in 1 subject in the tablet/fasted cohort, and 2 AEs in 1 subject in the tablet/fed cohort were reported. Of these events, 4 AEs were handled to be ADRs in 2 of 18 subjects. Two ADRs were in 1 subject in the solution/fasted cohort and 2 ADRs were in 1 subject in the tablet/fed cohort. AEs in the crossover group were as follows: 1 event each of WBC increased and neutrophil percentage increased in the solution/fasted cohort, 1 event of skin laceration in the tablet/fasted cohort, and 1 event each of WBC increased and neutrophil percentage increased in the tablet/fed cohort. No significant differences were found in the frequency or type of AEs between the different dosage forms (in 2 mg solution or 2 mg tablet) or between the presence and absence of meal at the time of administration of the tablet.  Three AEs were reported in 2 of 8 subjects in the 10 mg group. All AEs were handled to be ADRs. One event each of WBC increased, CRP increased, and urobilin urine present were reported.  No deaths, SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in all treatment groups. No abnormal ECG findings or abnormal changes in vital sign were found.","The ratios of geometric mean Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf values of 2 mg tablet to 2 mg solution in the fasted state were 0.890, 0.929, and 0.931, respectively, indicating that these values in tablet form were slightly lower than those in solution form. The t1/2,z, and MRTinf values in tablet form were similar to those in solution form, suggesting no significant difference in pharmacokinetics between the 2 formulations. The ratios of geometric mean Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf values of 2 mg tablet form in the fed state to that in the fasted state were 0.904, 0.921, and 0.920, respectively, indicating that absorption of S-888711 in the fed state was slightly lower than that in the fasted state. The Tmax, t1/2,z, and MRTinf values in the fed state were similar to those in the fasted state, suggesting no significant difference in pharmacokinetics between dietary conditions.  The ratios of geometric mean Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf values of the 10 mg tablet to the 2 mg tablet in the fed state were 3.87, 4.20, and 4.16, respectively, indicating that these values of the 10 mg tablet were higher than those of the 2 mg tablet in the fed state; the ratio of these parameters was slightly less than the dose ratio (5-fold).
