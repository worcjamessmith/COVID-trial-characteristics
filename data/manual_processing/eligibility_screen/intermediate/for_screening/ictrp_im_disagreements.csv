The subject is immunosuppressed as a result of an underlying illness or treatment with<br>             immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs, or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation<br>             therapy within the preceding 36 months.<br><br>          7. The subject has an active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or<br>             prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any<br>             hematological malignancy. For this criterion, active is defined as having received<br>             treatment within the past 5 years.<br><br>          8. The subject has long-term (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parenteral steroids,<br>             or high-dose inhaled steroids (>800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or<br>             equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (nasal and topical steroids are allowed).<br><br>          9.

The subject has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the<br>             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would<br>             interfere with the evaluation of responses. These conditions include any acute or<br>             chronic medical disease or conditions defined as persisting for 3 months (defines ad<br>             90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury,<br>             render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere<br>             with the evaluation of responses of the subject's successful completion of the study.<br><br>         12.

The subject has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator,<br>             place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to<br>             meet the requirements of the protocol.<br><br>         15.

Each dose is a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is currently recommended for patients following autoHSCT within 12 months of tranpslant. At Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC), patients commence a program of re-vaccination at 6 months post-autoHSCT. This includes two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine (separated by 4 weeks) if they have not received this by 6 months post-transplant. Quadrivalent standard dose vaccine (FluQuadri) contains 60 micrograms (µg) haemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 µg HA of each of the four influenza strains. Trivalent high dose vaccine (Fluzone-HD) contains 180 micrograms (µg) haemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5mL dose in the recommended ration of 60(µg) HA of each of the three influenza strains.<br>Throughout the study, patients will be sent a weekly short message service (SMS) asking whether they have experienced an ILI (fever with at least one acute respiratory symptom or sign) in the previous 7 days.
