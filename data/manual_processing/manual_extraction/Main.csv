With the help of a table of random numbers, the numbers between 1 and 6 are selected and the treatment allocation list is determined according to each number.
To execute the generated random sequence, the method of hiding coded boxes or cans is used. In this method, the cans are numbered in a random sequence and inside the boxes, the desired intervention (drug) or a sheet on which the random allocation is written, is provided to the executor with the condition that the boxes are completely sealed and The researcher assigns patients to the standard intervention and treatment group based on the order of patients' admission.
