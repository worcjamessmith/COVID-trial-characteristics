We examined the impact of a combination of human mass chemotherapy, snail control through mollusciciding and SjCTPI bovine vaccination on the human incidence of infection. Following the baseline survey, the interventions were implemented in 18 intervention groups from 2013 to 2017. The investigators, including the research team, and study participants were blind to the vaccine allocation. At baseline all residents (60 mg/kg directly observed split oral dose) and bovines (30 mg/kg directly feed oral dose) were treated with a directly observed oral dose of PZQ. Villages were then pair-matched for the RCT based on historical prevalence, baseline outcomes, and transmission ecology. One of three intervention ARMs (no specific intervention (control), human mass praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, mollusciciding) were randomly assigned to each pair to achieve three pairs per intervention type.

One color will be associated with a mild electrical shock (the CS+), the other colored circle is never associated with shock (the CS-). This will be followed immediately by the fear extinction phase in which they will look at both colored lights which will never be followed by shock. This paradigm is adapted from Milad, Orr, Pitman, & Rauch (2005). SCR will be recorded to reflect sympathetic arousal. SCR amplitude typically increases to the CS+ compared to the CS- in the acquisition phase, and then gradually reduces over the extinction phase. The slope of decline of SCR over the fear extinction phase reflects how well an individual can inhibit/regulate their fear and reflects their capacity for fear extinction learning.
